            <p>This is the gender apathetic flag, but gender and pronoun apathetic go hand in hand as the person does not care how others perceive their gender.</p>
            <p>Pronoun apathetic means the person uses any pronouns. Pronouns do not indicate a person's gender and it is ok to use any pronouns even when cisgender. Given that River uses she/they/he pronouns, instead of saying "River went shopping," someone could say "she went shopping," "he went shopping," or "they went shopping." Some may not like the word "apathetic" as it can be interpretted that you do not care about the significance of pronouns, so if someone asks for your pronouns you can tell them "any pronouns are fine" so they know you mean it in a positive and respectful way.</p>
